# Hotel Booking System Report

## 1. Introduction

### a. Application Overview:
The Hotel Booking System is a Python program designed to facilitate hotel room bookings. It allows users to input their desired arrival and departure dates, select whether they want breakfast during their stay, and specify the number of rooms they wish to book.

### b. Running the Program:
To run the program, you need to have Python installed on your system. Simply execute the Python script named `hotel_booking_system.py` using your preferred Python interpreter.

### c. Using the Program:
1. Upon running the program, users will be prompted to enter their arrival date, departure date, whether they want breakfast, and the number of rooms they wish to book.
2. After providing the necessary inputs, the program will calculate the total cost of the booking and display the booking details along with the total cost.

## 2. Body/Analysis

### a. Functional Requirements Coverage:
- **User Input Handling**: The program effectively handles user input for arrival and departure dates, breakfast preference, and number of rooms.
- **Booking Cost Calculation**: It accurately calculates the total cost of the booking based on the provided inputs.
- **Booking Details Display**: The program displays the booking details including arrival date, departure date, breakfast option, number of rooms booked, and total cost.

## 3. Results and Summary

### a. Results:
